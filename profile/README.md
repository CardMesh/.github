### About

CardMesh is an application aimed at modernizing the sharing of business cards within a company. It displays digital
business
cards in a web browser, accessible via NFC tags, QR-codes, or direct URLs.

The application is composed of a SvelteKit frontend and an Express REST API backend. To run the application, you need to
install both the web application and the REST API. The utilized database is MongoDB.
